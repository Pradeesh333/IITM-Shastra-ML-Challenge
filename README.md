# IITM-Shastra-ML-Challenge
## Problem Description
This competition is about predicting the number of deaths in a widespread pandemic.

The Healthcare system in India was heavily overburdened during the peak of the pandemic Covid-19 three years ago. Hospital beds for emergency patients were in demand. Resources fell short of what was required. Being able to predict the number of cases can help draft a plan of action well in advance. Resources can be acquired and sent to people in need.

The dataset corresponds to a record of COVID-19 cases in India in various states from January 2020 to August 2021. It also contains the corresponding number of cured patients and deaths. Use your inner AI spirit to predict the number of deaths on a future date.
